# Getting Started with LND Boilerplate

Welcome to the LND Boilerplate! This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up and using our modern landing page boilerplate. Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, LND Boilerplate provides everything you need to create fast, beautiful, and SEO-optimized landing pages.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up the development environment
- Understanding the monorepo structure
- Using the component library
- Creating content with MDX
- Deploying your application

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** 18.17 or later
- **Bun** 1.0 or later (recommended) or npm/yarn
- **Git** for version control

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lnd-boilerplate.git
cd lnd-boilerplate

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

## Project Structure

LND Boilerplate uses a monorepo structure with the following organization:

```
lnd-boilerplate/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ landing/          # Main Next.js application
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/              # UI component library
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/           # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ docs/                # Documentation
```

## Component Architecture

Our component system is organized in three tiers:

### 1. Primitives

Basic building blocks like Button, Card, Heading, and Text. These are styled with Tailwind CSS and follow shadcn/ui principles.

### 2. Compositions

Complex components assembled from primitives to solve business tasks. Examples include Hero, FeatureGrid, PricingTable, and ProductList.

### 3. Templates

High-level page skeletons that define the overall structure. We provide PublicLayout, PageLayout, CollectionLayout, and FullPageLayout.

## Creating Your First Page

Let's create a simple page using our component library:

```tsx
import { PublicLayout } from '@lnd/ui/templates';
import { Hero } from '@lnd/ui/components/marketing';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <PublicLayout>
      <Hero
        title="Welcome to My Site"
        subtitle="Built with LND Boilerplate"
        description="This is my amazing landing page."
        ctaButtons={[{ text: 'Get Started', variant: 'default' }]}
      />
    </PublicLayout>
  );
}
```

## Content Management with MDX

LND Boilerplate supports MDX for content management, allowing you to write content in Markdown with embedded React components. Each MDX file can include frontmatter for metadata.

## SEO Optimization

Built-in SEO utilities help you create optimized content:

- Automatic meta tag generation
- Open Graph and Twitter Card support
- Structured data (JSON-LD)
- Sitemap generation
- Robots.txt creation

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding, here are some next steps:

- Explore the component library in `packages/ui`
- Check out utility functions in `packages/utils`
- Customize the design system in `styles/globals.css`
- Add your own MDX content
- Deploy to your preferred hosting platform

## Getting Help

If you run into any issues or have questions:

- Check the documentation in the `docs/` folder
- Review the example pages in `apps/landing/app/`
- Open an issue on GitHub
- Join our community discussions

> **Pro Tip:** Use the development server's hot reload feature to see your changes instantly. The server is already running at `http://localhost:3000`.
