# First Steps

Welcome to LND Boilerplate! This guide will walk you through your first steps.

## Understanding the Structure

LND Boilerplate follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **Apps**: Your applications (landing, admin, etc.)
- **Packages**: Shared libraries and components
- **Content**: MDX and JSON content files

## Creating Your First Page

1. Navigate to `apps/landing/app/`
2. Create a new page file (e.g., `my-page.tsx`)
3. Use the provided templates for consistent styling

## Adding Content

Content is managed in the `_content/` directory:

- Blog posts go in `_content/blog/`
- Documentation in `_content/docs/`
- Expert profiles in `_content/experts/`

## Next Steps

- Try creating a new page
- Add some content
- Customize the styling
