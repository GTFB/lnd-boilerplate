# System Architecture

LND Boilerplate is built with a modern, scalable architecture that prioritizes developer experience, performance, and maintainability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Monorepo Structure

We use a monorepo approach to manage multiple related packages:

```
lnd-boilerplate/
├── apps/
│   └── landing/          # Next.js application
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/              # Shared UI components
│   └── utils/           # Shared utilities
└── _content/            # Content files
```

**Benefits:**

- Shared code between applications
- Consistent tooling and dependencies
- Simplified development workflow
- Atomic changes across packages

### 2. Component Architecture

Our component system follows a three-tier architecture:

#### Primitives

Basic building blocks that provide fundamental functionality.

#### Compositions

Complex components assembled from primitives.

#### Templates

High-level page skeletons that define overall structure.

### 3. Content-Driven Architecture

LND Boilerplate supports both content-driven and application-driven pages:

#### Content-Driven Pages

- Static content with MDX
- SEO-optimized
- Fast loading
- Perfect for blogs, documentation, marketing pages

#### Application-Driven Pages

- Dynamic, interactive content
- Real-time data
- User authentication
- Perfect for dashboards, admin panels, user accounts

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components

### Development Tools

- **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **ESLint** - Code linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking

## Configuration System

### Site Configuration (`site.config.json`)

Centralized configuration for the entire application:

```json
{
  "site": {
    "name": "LND Boilerplate",
    "description": "Modern web development platform"
  },
  "features": {
    "blog": { "enabled": true },
    "search": { "enabled": true },
    "documentation": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

## Content Management

### MDX Integration

MDX files are processed and rendered as React components:

```mdx
---
title: 'My Blog Post'
date: '2025-01-25'
---

# My Blog Post

This is **markdown** with <CustomComponent /> support.
```

### Content Processing Pipeline

1. **Discovery** - Find MDX files in content directories
2. **Parsing** - Extract frontmatter and content
3. **Processing** - Transform markdown to JSX
4. **Rendering** - Render as React components
5. **Caching** - Cache processed content for performance

## Performance Optimizations

### Static Generation

- Pre-render pages at build time
- Generate static HTML for content pages
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

### Code Splitting

- Automatic code splitting by route
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Lazy loading for non-critical features

## Security Considerations

### Content Security Policy

- Configured security headers
- XSS protection
- Input validation with ZOD schemas

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

### Code Quality

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Git hooks for validation

## Conclusion

LND Boilerplate's architecture is designed to be:

- **Scalable** - Can grow with your project
- **Maintainable** - Easy to understand and modify
- **Performant** - Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Developer-Friendly** - Great developer experience
- **Production-Ready** - Built for real-world applications

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building modern, high-performance web applications while maintaining flexibility for future growth and customization.
